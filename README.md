# Anomaly-Detection-


This project implements the anomaly detection algorithm by using the OOPs concepts for light intensity in a room and informs the user if there is change in light intensity by Twilio SMS API.

To implement the algorithm I have used z-score analysis for calculating the minimum and maximum threshold value.
For taking the light intensity as input I have used Bolt wifi module.

This project can also be used for monitoring the tempreture and can be implemented in any pharmaceutical companies.
